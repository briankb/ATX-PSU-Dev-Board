#Note
This documentation procedure is very rough and still in development. The goal of the documentation for the ATX PSU Dev Board was to experiment with reducing the amount of time required for documenting in multiple places. For this project a shell script was used to quickly prototype the workflow. It is far from an ideal solution, but has given us ideas for future implementations. 

#Triple Documentation Workflow
The main content is written in markdown. A title page for the PDF is created in LaTeX. The photos are edited in GIMP. ImageMagick and xcf2png are used to convert the GIMP files to png and scale them. We use pandoc to convert the markdown to mediawiki for reprap.org (and other websites). Next the markdown is converted to LaTeX and appended to the title page. We generate a PDF from the LaTeX. All of this is performed with the build.sh script.

#Contributing
Modifications to the documentation happen in the following files/folders.
*build.sh (Build script)
*user-manual.md (Human generated instructions)
*user-manual.tex (The title page for the PDF, includes the LaTeX output from pandoc)
*/xcf (All the pictures editable in GIMP)
Everything else is generated by a piece of software and is recreated each build (for now, however an ideal solution would be like a makefile).
